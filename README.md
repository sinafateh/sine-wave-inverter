### Inverter Design with Voltage Feedback Control  

**Project Title:** DC-to-AC Inverter with Feedback-Based Voltage Regulation  

---

**Description:**  
This project presents a DC-to-AC inverter system designed to generate a stable AC output while incorporating feedback control for voltage regulation. The feedback mechanism, though simplified, is modeled using a potentiometer and a DC voltage source. It dynamically adjusts the output through a PWM signal, which controls a buck-boost converter. This setup ensures consistent output voltage under varying load conditions.

**Key Features:**  
1. **Stable AC Output:** The system converts DC input to an AC sine wave using SPWM (Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation).  
2. **Voltage Feedback Control:** A simulated feedback loop adjusts the PWM duty cycle to regulate the inverter's output voltage. The feedback is modeled with a DC voltage source and potentiometer rather than a real-time system, allowing for simplified testing and adjustments.  
3. **Buck-Boost Converter Integration:** The feedback PWM signal directly controls a buck-boost converter, enabling precise voltage adjustments.  
4. **Load Adaptability:** The system maintains a stable output voltage despite changes in load conditions.

**How It Works:**  
1. The microcontroller generates a SPWM signal to control the inverterâ€™s switching transistors (e.g., MOSFETs).  
2. The feedback mechanism, modeled using a potentiometer and DC voltage source, provides a reference signal.  
3. The reference feedback signal is processed by the microcontroller, which adjusts the PWM duty cycle of a buck-boost converter.  
4. The buck-boost converter modifies the DC input voltage to ensure the inverter's output remains stable, providing a regulated AC waveform to the load.
